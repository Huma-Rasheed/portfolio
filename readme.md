## Overview

A portfolio mobile-first website built to showcase technical, web-design and creative skills.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Created a basic mobile-screen size layout. Increased size gradually to fit it in larger screens. Used media queries, added break points according to changes to be made in layout. Created one separate SCSS file specifically for media queries. Used javaScript active class for colour change of navigation buttons on click. Used combination of greyscale and hover pseudoclass to colour up project tiles as we hover over them, which otherwise are greyscale.
